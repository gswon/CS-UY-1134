Equation     
--> 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +...+ n = n(n+1)/2 = Θ(n<sup>2</sup>)   
--> 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 +...+ 2<sup>n+1 </sup> - 1 = Θ(2<sup>n</sup>)       
--> 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 +...+ n = 2n - 1 = Θ(n)  (1 to n is log(n) times)

What is Emortized Analysis?
- It is finding the total cost of a series of operation considering both costly and less costly operation.
- T<sub>amortized</sub>(n) = (total cost of entire series of n operation) / n
